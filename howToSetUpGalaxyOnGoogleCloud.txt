How to set up Galaxy on Google Cloud
====================================

1. Create a google instance (e.g. CentOS)

* May need to turn on http and https traffic on
* Open port 8080 (port 80 requires sudo access)
  Click on centos-7-1 -> Select Network -> Add firewall rule -> Allowed protocols and ports “tcp:8080”
  

2. Download and run galaxy

ssh to the instance
git clone https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy.git
cd galaxy
cp config/galaxy.ini.sample config/galaxy.ini
edit config/galaxy.ini
   host = 0.0.0.0  # listen to all open ports
   port = 8080     # keep
   environment_setup_file=/home/alexander/.bashrc # contains env variable settings

# Location where the egg packages are unzipped. Any directory within 
the home directory will do. (Not setting this variable will generate
a security warning, which brings icqsol.) 
export PYTHON_EGG_CACH=$HOME/python_egg
sh run.sh

You should be able to point your browser to your instance

3. Install icqsol
